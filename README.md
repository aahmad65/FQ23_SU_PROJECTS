<h1>Fall Quarter Projects, 2023</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

This quarter was much lighter when it came to coding. We did a lot of handwritten homework and in-class exercises so there was not much to show for this quarter. However, this was the Foundations of Computer Science class, where we learned a lot about logic.

P2: Testing Set Operations <br/>
P4: Graph Modeling <br/>
